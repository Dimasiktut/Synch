## Deployment

### Local Network

To allow access from other devices on your network:

1. Find your local IP address
2. Start the server: `npm start`
3. Access from other devices: `http://YOUR_IP:3000`

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your environment
2. Use a process manager like PM2
3. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
4. Enable HTTPS for WebRTC functionality
5. Consider using a TURN server for better connectivity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Media not syncing:**
- Check if all users are in the same room
- Use the "Sync" button to manually synchronize
- Ensure media file is properly loaded

**Voice chat not working:**
- Allow microphone permissions in browser
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure HTTPS in production

**Connection issues:**
- Check firewall settings
- Verify Socket.IO connection in browser console
- Ensure port 3000 is available
